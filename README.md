### Tech Stack
- Next.js App Router, React Server Components + Client Components
- p5.js in instance mode for rendering

- Zustand for state management
- Fuse.js for fuzzy search
- Web Workers for layout and heavy search
- LLM provider via server route (OpenAI-compatible), Redis cache
- Playwright, Vitest, React Testing Library
- Vercel deploy, GitHub Actions CI

### Architecture
- Rendering: p5 instance inside a client component, progressive rendering with hierarchical culling and label virtualization
- Layout: radial and rectangular trees computed in a Web Worker, cached server-side
- Hit testing: spatial index or color-picking buffer
- State: focus node, zoom/pan, layout, filters, theme, depth, selection
- API: server routes for tree slices, taxon metadata, search, and LLM
- Data: preprocessed Open Tree of Life JSON with enrichment (e.g., Wikipedia)

### Data Pipeline
- Source: Open Tree of Life synthetic tree
- Scripts: fetch and preprocess to hierarchical JSON with stable IDs, ranks, aliases
- Optional enrichment: description and image via Wikipedia REST, cached
- Output: public/data/tree.json; server routes slice by focus and depth

### API Contracts
- GET `/api/tree?focusId=<id>&depth=<n>&layout=<radial|rect>` ‚Üí nodes, edges, bbox
- GET `/api/taxon/<id>` ‚Üí metadata, lineage, related
- GET `/api/search?query=<q>` ‚Üí ranked taxa
- POST `/api/llm` { focusId, question } ‚Üí streamed text response

### UI and UX
- Top bar: search, breadcrumbs, theme toggle, share button
- Canvas: full-height, animated, zoomable, pannable
- Control panel: desktop docked right; mobile bottom sheet
- Info panel: tabs for Overview, Images, Lineage, Similar
- Interactions: hover highlight path-to-root; click to focus and zoom-in

### Theming
- next-themes with system default and persistence
- Tailwind CSS variables for palettes and high-contrast mode
- Color by taxonomy rank, kingdom, or trait with perceptually uniform ramps

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for node traversal and focus
- ARIA for UI controls and state
- Screen reader fallback lists of nodes and lineage
- Reduced motion preference honored

### Performance
- Progressive rendering by depth and viewport
- Offscreen buffers for static layers, batched draw calls
- requestAnimationFrame scheduling and dynamic LOD thresholds
- Worker layout, cached slices, fast search via Fuse.js and indexing

### LLM Integration
- Provider-agnostic server route with environment-configured keys
- Grounding with selected focus, lineage, and cached summaries
- Tools: compare taxa, explain simply, find related or interesting neighbors
- Caching, rate limiting, and streaming responses

### Browser Requirements

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

WebGL support required for canvas rendering.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Notes

- **Client-side Rendering**: p5.js runs only on the client, import dynamically with `ssr: false`
- **Instance Mode**: Use p5 instance mode to avoid global state pollution
- **Web Workers**: Compute layouts and search in workers for non-blocking UI
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Server renders UI shell, canvas loads progressively
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for LLM responses, browser cache for tree data
